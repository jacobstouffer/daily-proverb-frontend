        <span class="TextRun SCXW148780909 BCX0 NormalTextRun">My name is Jacob Stouffer. I live in California with my wonderful wife, Mariana. We are members of Grace Community Church. I became a Christian at age 30. Before then, I was what Solomon would call a fool. This means that I had 30 years of experience with foolish thinking, speaking, looking, and walking. I was saturated in habits of foolishness. But God, in his kindness, gave me a new life. The book of Proverbs has been instrumental in bringing me out of foolish and wicked habits and helping me walk according to God’s right path.&nbsp;</span><span class="EOP SCXW148780909 BCX0">&nbsp;</span>

        <span class="TextRun SCXW148780909 BCX0 NormalTextRun">I have been and continue to be instructed, encouraged, and challenged by the Proverbs. And I love using the Proverbs to instruct, encourage, and challenge others. To that end, I have set out to write a devotional for each of the proverbs from chapter 10 through chapter 29. In writing these devotionals, I endeavor to present the truth of God’s Word with accuracy, clarity, and conviction. I endeavor to teach the truth of God’s Word only after it has challenged and impacted my own heart (Colossians 3:16).</span><span class="EOP SCXW148780909 BCX0">&nbsp;</span>

        <span class="TextRun SCXW148780909 BCX0 NormalTextRun">My wife and I are applying for international adoption from Columbia! A big reason that I am writing these devotionals is that I want to be able to share the wisdom from God’s Word with my future children. If you have been blessed by this project and would like to make a one-time contribution to our adoption fund, my wife and I would be greatly blessed. All donations will be used for adoption related expenses. The adoption process will likely take 1-2 more years. I will update this page with any major developments in the adoption process as they happen.</span><span class="EOP SCXW148780909 BCX0">&nbsp;</span>
