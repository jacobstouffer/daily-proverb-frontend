        <span class="TextRun SCXW189217881 BCX0 NormalTextRun">The body of the book of Proverbs begins in chapter 10 verse 1. The previous nine chapters are considered the book’s introduction. I will not be writing a commentary on chapters 1 through 9, so I encourage anyone who uses the website to read and reread Proverbs 1-9 on your own! I reference these chapters <i>a lot</i>, because they set the stage for the individual proverbs in the rest of the book.&nbsp;</span><span class="EOP SCXW189217881 BCX0">&nbsp;</span>

        <span class="TextRun SCXW189217881 BCX0 NormalTextRun">I try to write each devotional as an independent unit that doesn’t require any previous knowledge. Thus, it is possible to read through these devotionals in a random order. There is nothing wrong with that! However, I recommend beginning with Proverbs 10:1 and reading through the devotionals in order. I recommend this because I often give much more explanation for a topic the first time I write about it. I also recommend this because of the fact that Solomon was intentional in how he arranged the individual proverbs (though we don’t always know the reason for his arrangement!).</span><span class="EOP SCXW189217881 BCX0">&nbsp;</span>
