        Proverbs 1 – 9
    </h3>

<div>
    <p>
        The body of the book of Proverbs begins in chapter 10 verse 1. The previous nine chapters are considered the book’s introduction. I will not be writing a commentary on chapters 1 through 9, so I encourage anyone who uses the website to read and reread Proverbs 1-9 on your own! I reference these chapters <i>a lot</i>, because they set the stage for the individual proverbs in the rest of the book.

        Reading in Order
    </h3>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        I try to write each devotional as an independent unit that doesn’t require any previous knowledge. Thus, it is possible to read through these devotionals in a random order. There is nothing wrong with that! However, I recommend beginning with Proverbs 10:1 and reading through the devotionals in order. I recommend this because I often give much more explanation for a topic the first time I write about it. I also recommend this because of the fact that Solomon was intentional in how he arranged the individual proverbs (though we don’t always know the reason for his arrangement!).

    <h3>Consider</h3>

    <p>
        My commentary on each proverb is <u>not definitive</u>. It is based on my study of the proverb as well as my limited experience. I was selective in what I wrote and chose not to attempt an exhaustive explanation of each subject. With each proverb, there is certainly more you can consider beyond what I wrote. There are certain implications and applications that I missed or omitted. Therefore, I encourage you to consider each proverb beyond my limited explanation. If it is more profitable for you to think through the proverbs without reading this devotional, I encourage you to do so! I certainly got much joy and benefit from doing that.

        Teaching Children
    </h3>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        The proverbs are useful to any person at any age, but they are <i>especially</i> helpful for a child in his preteen and teen years. Therefore, I recommend using these devotionals as a tool for walking through the proverbs with your preteen or teen.

        Unbelievers
    </h3>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        Finally, I encourage you to share this website with an unbeliever you know who expresses a desire to grow in wisdom. The proverbs of Solomon constantly challenge unbelievers to leave the path they are on and turn to God in trust and submission. They provide powerful portraits of the consequences of a life lived apart from God and the wonderful blessings of life with God. I also introduce readers to Christ and his Gospel throughout these devotionals whenever the content of the proverb warrants it.
