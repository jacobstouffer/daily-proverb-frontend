    Passage:
      'Treasure gained by wickedness does not profit,  But righteousness delivers from death. (ESV)',
    Commentary:
      "<div><p><span><span>Let’s look at this verse one part at a time.</span><span> </span></span></p></div><div><p><span><span>“Treasure gained by wickedness does not profit.” This word for “treasure” speaks of money or valuable possessions that can be stored up. When you have physical wealth, you hope that it can be of some benefit to you and perhaps to others (Matthew 6:1). Perhaps it can give you some advantage in life, helping you to be better off than you were before. This proverb says that if you gain the wealth through wickedness, it will be of no benefit, no advantage. </span><span> </span></span></p></div><div><div><p><span><span> </span></span></p></div><div><p><span><span>This flies in the face of contemporary wisdom. In various ways, the world wants to convince us that treasure gained by wickedness can profit; this idea is promoted by social media Influencers, television, movies, friends, and family. The temptation is everywhere. Here are a few examples of treasure gained by wickedness to stimulate your thinking:</span><span> </span></span></p></div><div><ul><li><p><span><span>Lying on your taxes</span><span> </span></span></p></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><p><span><span>Lying on your resume or lying in an interview in order to get a job</span><span> </span></span></p></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><p><span><span>Lying about the product or service that you’re selling</span><span> </span></span></p></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><p><span><span>Using deception to trap a customer into a bad contract</span><span> </span></span></p></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><p><span><span>Misusing company funds</span><span> </span></span></p></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><p><span><span>Wrongfully suing </span><span> </span></span></p></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><p><span><span>Stealing from your work</span><span> </span></span></p></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><p><span><span>Slandering someone so that you get a promotion instead of them</span><span> </span></span></p></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><p><span><span>Working illegally</span><span> </span></span></p></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><p><span><span>Receiving government benefits through lying</span><span> </span></span></p></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><p><span><span>Cyber-attacks on your company’s competitors</span><span> </span></span></p></li></ul></div><div><p><span><span> </span></span></p></div><div><p><span><span>You may get money from it, but that treasure will never profit you.
