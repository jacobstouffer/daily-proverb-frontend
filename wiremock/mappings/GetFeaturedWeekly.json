They can hold an audience captive, talk themselves out of trouble, or make people laugh with a long-winded joke. Others are “nervous talkers”: they continue talking because they’re afraid of what might happen when the talking stops. Some talk to others for hours as a means of therapy. Others talk for hours as a means of income. Whatever the motive, endless talking is the norm, especially in American culture. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Todays proverb emphasizes the wisdom of something with which many of us have very little practice: shutting our mouths. This simple principle will challenge us, correct us, and benefit us as we seek to communicate in a wise and righteous way.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“When words are many, transgression does not cease.” What a simple but profound truth! Consider how many of God’s rules are violated through speech. Here are a few: lying, crude jokes, insults, slander, gossip, blasphemy, boasting, and harsh words. Suppose that two people are talking for ten minutes and have fallen into one or more of the above transgressions. Will the transgressions cease if the two people continue talking for another hour? Quite the opposite! Suppose that someone is giving an improvisational speech, and he tells three lies within the first two minutes of the speech. Will his transgressions cease if his speech continues for another twenty minutes? Don’t count on it!</span></p><p> </p><p><span>We often catch ourselves in sin while talking and we want to stop sinning. But as we keep talking, the transgression doesn’t cease. Why not? Why is it so hard to stop? One reason is that it is difficult to be prudent <i>while talking. </i>To be prudent is to be careful. It means to consider or ponder in order to govern one’s life. While talking, we are occupied and have no opportunity to consider or ponder our words. As we continue talking, our careless words continue. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Then what do we do if were caught in transgression through our words? “He who holds back his lips is prudent.” Dont try to make it work. Don’t try to use many words to turn things around. Just stop talking. The best way to stop the transgression is to stop the talking. This might involve ending the conversation, dismissing yourself from the conversation, or stopping your monologue. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>When we stop talking, our transgressions cease. It’s a simple formula. If there are transgressions that can only be committed through speech, we can eliminate those transgressions by refusing to speak.</span><a href=\\"#_ftn1\\" name=\\"_ftnref1\\"><span><span>[1]</span></span></a><span> How do you stop gossip? Stop talking. How do you stop irreverence? Stop talking. How do you stop rudeness? Stop talking.</span><a href=\\"#_ftn2\\" name=\\"_ftnref2\\"><span><span>[2]</span></span></a><span> </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The second line of this proverb doesn’t only apply to situations in which transgressions have already occurred. It also applies to conversations where no transgression has yet occurred. If nobody has started to talk carelessly, don’t be the one to start! Ponder what you will say. Be careful. Hold back your lips from sins that have entrapped you in the past. In this way, you will be prudent.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>How would you rate your own talking in the last week? In what situations have you been careless with your words? Which sins of the tongue have you fallen into? How can you apply this proverb in order to honor the Lord Jesus with your speech and love your neighbor as yourself?</span></p><p><br /> </p><div><hr /><div><p><a href=\\"#_ftnref1\\" name=\\"_ftn1\\"><span><span>[1]</span></span></a> We recognize that keeping silent doesn’t eliminate all transgressions. There can still be transgressions in the heart. However, there are some transgressions that only occur through speaking aloud to another person; these are the ones that can be avoided by being silent.</p></div><div><p><a href=\\"#_ftnref2\\" name=\\"_ftn2\\"><span><span>[2]</span></span></a> This proverb doesn’t give us the complete picture on communication. It focuses on holding back (putting off). Other proverbs focus on kind and beneficial speech (putting on).</p></div></div>"}',
